        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 0em;">Hi, my name is Zac Beers. I am a web developer and digital designer, with a passion for merging art and code.</p>
        <p>When I create a website, I do more than deliver text and images - I'm interested in creating a full immersive experience that really connects people with your brand. I am passionate about animation, studying new web design trends, and producing work that I'm proud of. I find that animation adds a touch of fun and helps users navigate difficult areas of a site. I love to focus on designing engaging user experiences to deliver a product that looks great, feels welcoming, and works flawlessly.</p>
        <p>I've pursued my interest in programming since childhood, and successfully started my freelance business while still in high school. I have gained knowledge of the full spectrum of web development and design through my experience working for several different companies.</p>
        <p>I'm available for your projects - large, small, or anything in between. You can reach me either by phone <a href="tel:13234078648">323-407-8648</a> or email <a href="mailto:zacbeers@gmail.com">zacbeers@gmail.com</a></p>
