        <p style="margin-top: 0em;">Hi, my name is Zac Beers. I've been crafting websites and digital media for around 10 years now. I had picked up the programs when I was very young, and spend my time perfecting those skills. By the time I was in high school I had already worked on several freelance assignments and was beginning to pursue larger agencies. When I create a website I'm not simply interested in a way to deliver the text and images, but rather a full immersive experience that really connects people with your brand. I prefer to focus on user experience and interation design to deliver a product that not only works well, but looks and feels great. I have a passion for animating and enjoy including movement into my designs whenever it's useful. Not only can that help to explain difficult areas of a site, but can also add a touch of fun. Whether on the clock or not, I'm always making something on my computer. You can keep up to date with what I'm working on via any of the social media channels I use, as well as at news.zacbeers.com where I've recently begun to blog about my experiences in the industry. I am currently available for freelance work, and can be easily reached either by phone <a href="tel:13234078648">323-407-8648</a> or email <a href="mailto:zacbeers@gmail.com">zacbeers@gmail.com</a> Although I've worked in multiple disciplines, my expertise lies in front-end development and interaction design. I have a passion for solving problems, constantly perfecting my craft, and producing work that I can be proud of. I'm currently available for projects small or large, so if you're interested in hiring me, check out my work, and let's get in touch!</p>
