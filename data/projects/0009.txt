They already had a system developed through Spot POS to send the letters, my job was to give them a glossy new finish.%nimages/projects/0009_6.png%nIn addition to all the promotional material, I also got a chance to build a few internal systems to enhance the team's productivity. One of which was an image sharing tool which would help both Customer Service and the Designers to keep customers photos organized.%nimages/projects/0009_7.png%nThe backend was build using my forte language, php, and allowed for uploading, downloading, re-ordering, and deleting image files.%nimages/projects/0009_8.png
