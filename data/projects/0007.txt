Family Physical Therapy is a clinic located in Waterbury, Vermont. They needed an exciting web presence that would help patients learn about their practice.%nimages/projects/0007_0.png%nimages/projects/0007_1.png%nThe client wanted to create a strong "above the fold" homepage, where you can see everything you need without having to scroll down too far. With this design most pages are only a single click away.%nimages/projects/0007_2.png%nThere was a lot of information to include on the website, and much more to come in the future.
