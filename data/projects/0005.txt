This was an exciting project to work on. Responsive design, backend development, login and registration system, and inventory management all came together to create USCarzz's online debut.%nsrc="images/projects/0005_0.png" alt="us carzz web development" title="us carzz web development"%nThere were many features required by this website, one of which was that it needed to be mobile friendly. Often there's not much time to shop for a car, and their customers need to be able to check out their inventory wherever they go. The finished site is fully responsive, and will look great no matter what device their customers decide to use.%nsrc="images/projects/0005_1.png" alt="mobile friendly responsive website" title="mobile friendly responsive website"%nAdditionally the site needed to feature a way for the users to save their favorite vehicles to a sort of wish list, so that they could remember their favorites. To solve that, I started with a register an login system built using php.%nsrc="images/projects/0005_2.png" alt="registering new user accounts" title="registering new user accounts"%nThis made it convienient for users to come back and see their personal information. Here they are able to manage many parts of their profile, most importantly, their list of favorite vehicles.%nsrc="images/projects/0005_3.png" alt="personal profile page example" title="personal profile page example"%nAnd of course the customers will want to browse through their inventory. It's set up so they can find the car they're looking for quickly and easily. Opening up the Advanced Search Options gives the ability to sort the results by Year, Make, Model, Mpg, and Price Range.%nsrc="images/projects/0005_4.png" alt="browse current inventory webpage" title="browse current inventory webpage"%nClicking on an individual vehicle gives them an array of options including, adding it to their favorites list, sharing on facebook and twitter, and emailing the car to a friend. They are even able to put in an offer to buy the car through the website.%nsrc="images/projects/0005_5.png" alt="vehicle details page design" title="vehicle details page design"%nThe website just launched, and they are already expecting a big rise in business. This website will hopefully help them to sell a whole lot of cars in the coming months.%nsrc="images/projects/0005_6.png" alt="us carzz web design" title="us carzz web design"
